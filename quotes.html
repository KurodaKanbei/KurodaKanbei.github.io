<p> <i> This page is the archive of the most inspiring and motivating words I have ever heard or read. Some of them may be rephrased and translated. </i></p>

<p> The most interesting and fascinating stuff in the world are always about the others' life, likewise television and the social media. But at the end of the day, please be aware that it is none of your business. -- Kevin Tsai</p>

<p> Please don't say you tried everything but nothing works. Please say it after you indeed tried everything. -- "Chihayafuru" </p>

<p> The word "peer pressure" is acutally an oxymoron. Never compare yourself with others. The only thing you should care about is that whether you are better than yesterday. -- Prof. Dr. Zhendong Su </p>

<p> Blood, tear, sweat, having a positive attitude, working on the right track, and so on. Unfortuantely, none of the above can ensure your success, but at least you will not deviate by a lot. -- "Real Fans Gathering"</p>

<p> Do not give up just because it takes time to do so. Time itself flies anyway. -- Anonymous</p>

<p> Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can. -- Arthur Ashe </p>

<p> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn. -- Benjamin Franklin </p>

<p> Anyone can deal with victory. Only the mighty can bear defeat. -- Adolf Hitler </p>

<p> I would rather aim for the stars and not hit them than to not aim at all. I would rather go after it and not get it than not go after it at all. I'd rather try and fail than not try at all. I don't wanna live with the idea, wondering what would have happened had I done more with my life. I'm gonna go for it. Come hell or high water I'm going after my destiny. -- T.D. Jakes </p>

<p> The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours. You young people, full of vigour and vitality, are in the bloom of life, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you. -- President Mao </p>
