<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at 
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and affiliated with the Coordinated Science Laboratory. My research focuses on building fundamental connections between control and machine learning. Currently I am most interested in</p>
<ul>
<li><p> System/control tools for understanding generalization in overparameterized deep learning models</p>
</li>
<li><p> Connections between robust control and deep reinforcement learning</p>
</li>
<li><p> Connections between control and stochastic optimization</p>
</li>
</ul>
  
  
<p> I received the B.Sc. in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2008, and received 
  the M.S. in Computational Mechanics from Carnegie Mellon University in 2010. I received the Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics at 
  the University of Minnesota in 2016, under the supervision of Peter Seiler. Between July 2016 and July 2018, I was a postdoctoral researcher 
  in the Wisconsin Institute for Discovery at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. At Madison, I was working with Laurent Lessard and closely collaborating with Stephen Wright. </p>
