<h1>Research <br /></h1>
</div>
<p> I am interested
in building fundamental connections between the techniques used in the computer vision and adversarial machine learning
communities.   Specifically, my current research focuses on developing new analysis/design/validation tools that ensure an efficient and safe integration of computer vision
and learning techniques for next generation intelligent systems such as self-driving cars, advanced robotics, and smart buildings. </p>

<h2>3d Scene Understanding and Robotic Planning</h2>
<p> While affordable censors have granted us a convienient way to collect real world data, effective engines and environment like MuJoCo, Gibson and Unreal have been established to get fast and accurate simulation. However, how to bridge the gap between synthetic and real world remain unsolved. Meanwile, the sparse award in real world task brings much difficulty to the reinforcement learning and robotic planning in specific task like grasping and inserting. My research experience advised by Prof. Cewu Lu focused on solving such problems by building new benchmarks and engines.</p>

<h2>Adversarial Learning for Safety-Critical AI</h2>
<p>I am interested in reconciling defending adversarial examples with computer vision for safety-critical AI applications. What appeals to me most is the existance of adversarial examples without expensive manipulation and the method to defend them which can't be specifically attacked. One increasingly popular topic among these is exposing the artifacts of the fake videos. This part of research was done during my internship at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, supervised by Prof. Bo Li. </p>


<h2>Efficient and Guaranted Evaluation of Robustness</h2>
<p> Nowadays, the deep neural networks are becoming more and more complicated and elaborated which raise up the cost of evaluating their robustness. Hence, empirical experiments are also expensive and vary a lot when the data density changes. I contributes to the efficient evaluation of lipschitz constant of feed-forward networks and infinite depth recurrent neural networks. This part of research was done during my internship at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, supervised by Prof. Bin Hu.</p>
